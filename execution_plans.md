    "Viability": "Not Viable",
    "Reason": "The 10-day moving average (2750.15) is below the 50-day moving average (2924.58), meaning there is no golden cross. While the RSI at 35.68 is below 40, satisfying one condition, the absence of the golden cross prevents execution.",
    "Execution Plan": "No trade is recommended based on this strategy at this time."
  },
  "Strategy 2: MACD Bullish Crossover with Volume Surge": {
    "Viability": "Not Viable",
    "Reason": "The MACD line (-60.24) is below the signal line (-14.11), indicating a bearish trend, not the required bullish crossover.",
    "Execution Plan": "No trade is recommended based on this strategy at this time."
  },
  "Strategy 3: Bollinger Band Breakout with High Volatility": {
    "Viability": "Potentially Viable, but with caution",
    "Reason": "The current price (1221.05) is below the midpoint of the Bollinger Bands (approximately 1269.81). While the exact upper and lower band values are needed to confirm a breakout, the current positioning suggests a potential for a short position if the price breaks below the lower band.",
    "Execution Plan (Hypothetical Short Position if breakout occurs)": {
      "Entry Condition": "Enter a short position if the price decisively breaks below the lower Bollinger Band. This needs to be monitored closely with real-time data to confirm the breakout.",
      "Exit Condition": "Exit the short position when the price reverses and crosses back inside the lower Bollinger Band, or when a predetermined profit target is reached (e.g., a small percentage gain).",
      "Stop-Loss": "Place a stop-loss order just above the lower Bollinger Band after entry. The placement should account for current volatility.",
      "Trade Timing": "Monitor the price action closely and execute only if the breakout is clear and accompanied by an increase in volume, confirming downward momentum.",
      "Risk Management": "Allocate only a small portion of capital to this trade due to its high-risk nature. Be prepared for potential whipsaws and false breakouts."

  "Overall Recommendation": "Based on the current market conditions, a conservative approach is recommended. Only the Bollinger Band Breakout strategy presents a potential opportunity for a short position if a clear breakout below the lower band occurs. The other strategies do not currently meet their entry conditions. Continuous monitoring of market conditions and real-time data is crucial before making any trading decisions. Risk management is paramount."
