 "Day Trading Strategy 1: Golden Cross and RSI Confirmation": {
  "Description": "This strategy aims to capitalize on short-term bullish momentum when a golden cross occurs, with added confirmation from the Relative Strength Index (RSI). It aligns with a high-risk tolerance by entering positions based on potentially strong upward price movements.",
  "Rationale": "A golden cross suggests a shift from a downtrend to an uptrend. Combining this with an oversold RSI provides a potentially higher probability entry point.",
  "Entry Condition": "Enter a long position when the 10-day moving average crosses above the 50-day moving average AND the RSI is below 40. The RSI being below 40, but not necessarily below 30, allows for capturing the early momentum of a potential uptrend in a high-risk scenario.",
  "Exit Condition": "Exit the position when the RSI reaches 70 (overbought condition) OR if a death cross occurs (the 10-day moving average crosses below the 50-day moving average). This allows for capturing profit on the upward swing while limiting exposure if the trend reverses.",
  "Stop-Loss": "Place a stop-loss order slightly below the recent swing low prior to the entry signal. This helps to limit potential losses if the trade goes against the anticipated direction. A tighter stop-loss is acceptable given the high-risk, high-reward nature.",
  "Risk Management": "Allocate a small percentage of trading capital to this strategy due to its higher risk. Monitor the trade actively and be prepared to exit if the conditions change rapidly.",
  "Indicators Used": ["10-day Moving Average", "50-day Moving Average", "Relative Strength Index (RSI)"]
 },
 "Day Trading Strategy 2: MACD Bullish Crossover with Volume Surge": {
  "Description": "This strategy focuses on entering positions when the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicates bullish momentum, confirmed by a surge in trading volume. It suits a high-risk appetite by leveraging increased investor interest for quick gains.",
  "Rationale": "A bullish MACD crossover suggests increasing upward momentum. A concurrent surge in volume adds conviction to the signal, indicating stronger buying pressure.",
  "Entry Condition": "Enter a long position when the MACD line crosses above the signal line AND there is a noticeable increase in trading volume compared to the recent average. This confirms the strength behind the potential upward move.",
  "Exit Condition": "Exit the position when the MACD line crosses below the signal line (bearish crossover) OR when a predetermined profit target is reached (e.g., a percentage gain). Given the high-risk tolerance, a slightly more aggressive profit target can be considered.",
  "Stop-Loss": "Place a stop-loss order slightly below the recent swing low preceding the entry signal. This protects capital against unexpected price reversals.",
  "Risk Management": "Manage risk by limiting the capital allocated to this strategy. High volatility associated with volume surges requires careful monitoring and quick decision-making.",
  "Indicators Used": ["MACD", "Trading Volume"]
 },
 "Day Trading Strategy 3: Bollinger Band Breakout with High Volatility": {
  "Description": "This strategy aims to profit from price breakouts when volatility is high, as indicated by widening Bollinger Bands. It is inherently risky and aligns with a high-risk tolerance by targeting potentially rapid price movements.",
  "Rationale": "Widening Bollinger Bands signify increased market volatility, which can lead to significant price swings. A breakout above the upper band or below the lower band can present short-term trading opportunities.",
  "Entry Condition": "Enter a long position when the price breaks above the upper Bollinger Band OR enter a short position when the price breaks below the lower Bollinger Band. The focus here is on capitalizing on the momentum of the breakout.",
  "Exit Condition": "For long positions, exit when the price reverses and crosses back inside the upper Bollinger Band OR when a predetermined profit target is achieved. For short positions, exit when the price reverses and crosses back inside the lower Bollinger Band OR when a predetermined profit target is achieved.",
  "Stop-Loss": "For long positions, place a stop-loss order just below the upper Bollinger Band after entry. For short positions, place a stop-loss order just above the lower Bollinger Band after entry. Due to the high volatility, wider stop-loss placements might be necessary but should be carefully considered.",
  "Risk Management": "This strategy carries a high degree of risk due to its reliance on volatility. Employ strict risk management by allocating a minimal portion of capital and actively monitoring trades. Be prepared for whipsaws and false breakouts.",
